Terraria, now with Temperature! Now in 1.4!

Ever wanted to die of Heat Stroke or Hypothermia in Terraria? Now you can! Here is a list of additions & changes for your dying pleasure:
+ Temperature, influenced by the biome you're in, time of day, humidity, wind speed, and many other factors
+ New "Thermometer" item that displays several different temperature related statistics (Hint: Might want to make one of these as soon as possible)
+ Entirely new accessories that can twist the temperature toward your advantage
* Every armor set & many accesories grant effects to combat the elements
* Many buff and debuff changes that now affect temperature
