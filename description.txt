Terraria 1.4, now with Temperature!

Ever wanted to die of Heat Stroke or Hypothermia in Terraria? Now you can! Here is a list of additions & changes for your dying pleasure:

+ Temperature, influenced by the biome you're in, time of day, humidity, wind speed, and many other factors
+ New "Thermometer" UI that displays temperature statistics
+ Entirely new accessories that can twist the temperature toward your advantage
* Every armor set & many accesories grant effects to combat the elements
* Many buff and debuff changes that now affect temperature

If you'd like to contribute to the mod or give suggestions, check out the forum homepage; from there you can see the GitHub repository as well as a link to join the mod discord, if you'd like to join it.

Note: If you notice that upon generating a new world that there is no wind, that's not a bug, that is intentional to make sure you can survive your first few days more easily!

Happy Freezing and/or Burning!
