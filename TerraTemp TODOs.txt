Legend: ? = Potential change, on the fence about it

TODOs:
-Special TerraTemp Prefixes
-"Enchantment" system (Flame & Frost enchantments) for modded armors and maybe? modded accessories
-Finish the wiki

Done:
-Cold attacks should instantly lower body temperature slightly
-Week based deviation system
-Wind chill effect caps out at 45mph
-Meterologist NPC
-Forecast UI
-Slightly nerf Hallowed Armor set bonus & Endurance potion buff

Whenever TODOs:
-Make the entire world extremely cold while the Moon Lord is alive (Send a message like "The earth freezes at the touch of the moon!" upon first impending doom message)?
-Make lava increase temperature by a much more balanced amount rather than instant death?
