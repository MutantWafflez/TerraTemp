Legend: ? = Potential change, on the fence about it

Version 1.1 TODOs (Compatability Update):

-Compatibility of Overhaul (Season influence)
-Compatibility of Calamity (Biomes, mostly. NOT doing all the accessories/armor ever? though)
-Change how water changes the temperature of the player (like just globally cooling people down)
-Lower extreme temperatures of Jungle/Ice?
-Holding/being near a torch will increase your temperature *ever* so slightly
-Make sure to add loadAfter for all of the mods that are officially compatible
-Depth. Influence.

Done:
-Make items keep TerraTemp bonuses if anywhere in the crafting tree it uses an item that boosts stats
-Add infrastructure for making easy mod compatibility with Reflection
-Furnaces should increase temperature slightly when in proximity
-Holding out Umbrellas now lower the intensity of the sun
-Streamlined lots of internal code
-Compatibility of Various Weathers (All of the events!)
-Add "Shade" Influence to help protect against the sun
-Thermometer now displays a proper UI

Whenever TODOs:
-Cold attacks should instantly lower body temperature slightly
-Make the entire world extremely cold while the Moon Lord is alive (Send a message like "The earth freezes at the touch of the moon!" upon first impending doom message)?
-Moon phases affect strength of the temperature decrease at night?
-Make lava increase temperature by a much more balanced amount rather than instant death?
-Meterologist NPC?
