Legend: ? = Potential change, on the fence about it

Version 1.1 TODOs (Compatability Update):

-Compatability of Overhaul (Season influence)
-Compatability of Various Weathers (All of the events!)
-Compatability of Calamity (Biomes, mostly. NOT doing all the accessories/armor ever? though)
-Make items keep TerraTemp bonuses if anywhere in the crafting tree it uses an item that boosts stats (Done)
-Depth. Influence.

Whenever TODOs:
-Cold attacks should instantly lower body temperature slightly
-Make the entire world extremely cold while the Moon Lord is alive (Send a message like "The earth freezes at the touch of the moon!" upon first impending doom message)?
-Moon phases affect strength of the temperature decrease at night?
-Make lava increase temperature by a much more balanced amount rather than instant death?
-Meterologist NPC?
